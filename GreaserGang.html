    <p class="display">The Greaser Gang is a gang to take serious. They are a violent bunch of dogs that thrive off of violence, ruining the lives of CatDog, mainly Cat, and destroying anything they want to because they are the Grease Gang.</p>
    <p class="display">They do howver live a different lifestyle then what most expect. Withing the gang, one does balet, the other does figure skating and the other, well the other lives their best life so we can not hate on that:)</p>
    <p class="display">Overall fear the bunch because they might be by your dumbster, punching a trash can waiting for their next opportuntiy or victim>:)</p>
